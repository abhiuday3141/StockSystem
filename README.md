1) We have to press numbers for it work that is difficult for non-programmers
2) Very basic just in short just displays the data the user gives without any other functionality

## Notable features in this project

1) Use of arrow-keys for basic navigation with functionality of buttons
2) Easily understood by non-programmers and easy to understand
3) Has the feature of getting smart strategical suggestion to maximize profit for any entered stock
4) Store and view your stocks efficiently

## HOW TO RUN

Just download all the files in 1 folder and compile the main file

The implementation of all the required Algorithms can be viewed from the appropriately named cpp files provided here
Since using a string in this project we cannot utilize direct dat files for storing data since they require to make jumps of constance size 
Here we have utlized to functions that convert one data structure to another for effective usage
